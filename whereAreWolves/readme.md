Hi! For my project, I made a trivia game, and I used JQuery, HTML, and CSS to make this project along with Git.

I wanted to create a game that people would enjoy playing - weather or not this is true is still to be determined. I made fun creating the game, and learned a lot about CSS, HTML, Git and JQuery.

As a user, I should be able to answer quiz questions, and change my answer before I submit my final answer.
As a user, I should learn after answering what questions I got right and what questions I got wrong.
